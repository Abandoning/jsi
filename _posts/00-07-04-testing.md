It's time to learn more Ember!

If you haven't already started looking into testing, take a look today.

Testing with Mocha, Chai, and Karma will require a bit of setup. Ask and you
shall receive (the appropriate resources aren't yet up on the Internet). Also,
the unit test helpers won't work with Mocah, but there's another way you can
isolate pieces of an application for testing.

Make sure you can answer the following questions:

- What's required to set up a testing environment?
- How does Ember deal with asynchronous testing?

You should be able to:

- Write tests for user interaction.
- Write unit tests.

If your group is a little ahead of schedule, let's discuss how you might
structure testing an application where the front end is using a back-end API.
