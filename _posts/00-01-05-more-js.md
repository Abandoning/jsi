Today's class covers a few basics that we intentionally skipped along the way.

## Iteration

JavaScript has many built in ways to iterate and loop:

{% highlight javascript %}
['water', 'coffee', 'tea'].forEach(function(beverage) {
  console.log('%s is delicious!', beverage);
});
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight javascript %}
var array = ['water', 'coffee', 'tea'];
for (var i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) {
  var beverage = array[i];
  console.log('%s is delicious!', beverage);
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
var i = 0;
var array = ['water', 'coffee', 'tea'];
while (i &lt; array.length) {
  var beverage = array[i];
  console.log('%s is delicious!', beverage);
  i++;
}
{% endhighlight %}


## Equality and Type Coercion

The following if statement is truthy:

{% highlight javascript %}
if (false == '0') { /* this is executed */ }
{% endhighlight %}

If `'0'` and `false` are equal, one may expect that the string `'0'` would
always be false. But try this:

{% highlight javascript %}
if ('0') { /* this is executed */ }
{% endhighlight %}

These strange rules have led JavaScript developers to simply favor the `===`
and `!==` operators instead of using `==` and `!=`. JSHint will check for this.

See [this discussion on StackOverflow][so-equality] for more details on
equality and coercion.


## Project

There's no project on the calendar for today. We have some options:

- Ask questions, review previous concepts
- Write more code, return to previous projects, improve and complete them
- Re-work some previous code to use for and while loops
- Move on to new material
