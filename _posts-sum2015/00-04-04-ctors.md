## Review: Methods and _this_

Here is a simple instance object representing a rectangle:
{% highlight javascript %}
var rect = {
	width:2,
	height:1
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here is an ordinary function which can compute a rectangle's area.  We might call it "freelance" since it belongs to no particular rectangle:
{% highlight javascript %}
function area(rect) { //needs target object as argument
	return rect.width * rect.height;
}
var answer = area(rect);
{% endhighlight %}

We can attach that function as a method:
{% highlight javascript %}
var rect1 = {
	width:1,
	height:2,
	area: function() { //no target arg needed
		return rect1.width * rect1.height;
	}
};
answer = rect1.area();
{% endhighlight %}

But a better alternative uses the keyword `this`:
{% highlight javascript %}
var rect2 = {
	width:2,
	height:3,
	area: function() {
		return this.width * this.height;
	}
};
answer = rect2.area();
{% endhighlight %}

_Why is using 'this' better?_



### Lexical vs. Dynamic Scoping

All variables we've ever seen are 'lexically' scoped--
the declaration they refer to (the closure for that variable) can be determined in advance by looking at the structure of the code (how function definitions are nested).

For example: what is the scope of `rect1` in
{% highlight javascript %}
var rect1 = {
	width:1,
	height:2,
	area: function() { //no target arg needed
		return rect1.width * rect1.height;
	}
};
{% endhighlight %}

The word `this` behaves somewhat like a variable, except:

1. You can never set it (e.g. `this=that`)

2. It always refers to an object, never a primitive

3. It is 'dynamically' scoped; its referent cannot be determined by looking at the code surrounding it.  Its value is not determined by closure, like a local variable, but instead depends on how its function is called, like a parameter.  It is essentially an invisible parameter.

For example:
{% highlight javascript %}
var rect2 = {
	width:2,
	height:3,
	area: function() {
		return this.width * this.height;
	}
};
answer = rect2.area();
{% endhighlight %}

`this` refers to rect2, but _not because the function is 'embedded' in the description of rect2_.  Instead, it's only because the function is called as a method of rect2.


### Sharing methods:
{% highlight javascript %}
var square1 = {
	width:1,
	height:1,
	area: rect2.area; // share rect2's method
}
answer = square1.area();
{% endhighlight %}

#### Single-use borrowing with _call_
Object has no method of its own:
{% highlight javascript %}
var square2 = {
	width:2,
	height:2
}
{% endhighlight %}

Hard way:
{% highlight javascript %}
square2.area = rect2.area;
answer = square2.area();
delete square2.area;
{% endhighlight %}

Easy way: the 'call' method
{% highlight javascript %}
answer = rect2.area.call(square2);
{% endhighlight %}

Freelance method:
{% highlight javascript %}
function area() {
	return this.width * this.height;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Permanently shared:
{% highlight javascript %}
var rhombus1 = {width:1, height:1, area:area};
var rhombus2 = {width:2, height:2, area:area};
answer = rhombus1.area();
answer = rhombus2.area();
{% endhighlight %}

Borrowed on demand:
{% highlight javascript %}
var rhombus3 = {width:3, height:2};
var rhombus4 = {width:4, height:2};
answer = area.call(rhombus1);
answer = area.call(rhombus2);
{% endhighlight %}


### Global object

What happens here?
{% highlight javascript %}
answer = area();
{% endhighlight %}


*Hazard:* callback function within method:
{% highlight javascript %}
var shapes = [square1, rhombus1, rhombus2];
shapes.areas = function() {
	return this.map(area);
}
answer = shapes.areas(); // failure!
{% endhighlight %}

**EXERCISE:** fix it!



## Factories &amp; Shared Methods

How can we mass-produce rectangles?

{% highlight javascript %}
function makeRect(w,h) {
	var rect = {};
	rect.width = w;
	rect.height = h;
	// personal instance method:
	rect.area = function() {
		return this.height * this.width
	}
	return rect;
}
var rect4 = makeRect(4,4);
answer = rect4.area();
{% endhighlight %}

Disadvantage: all rect instances have identical duplicate methods.
How can we share them between instances?

### Shared instance method patterns

- Global Freelance function or method.

	**EXERCISE:**  write a rectangle factory with a global shared instance method

- Freelance method in closure, not global

	- Named meta-factory

	**EXERCISE:** write a function which returns a rectangle factory,
 	whose instances share a method in a closure

	- IIFE!

	**EXERCISE:** write an immediately-invoked anonymous function which returns a rectangle factory, whose instances share a method in the IIFE's closure. 

- Method initially attached to factory:

{% highlight javascript %}
function makeRect(w,h) {
	var rect = {};
	rect.width = w;
	rect.height = h;
	rect.area = makeRect.area;
	return rect;
}
makeRect.area = function() {
	return this.width * this.height;
}
var rect5 = makeRect(5,2);
rect5.area();
{% endhighlight %}

- Method attached to prototype... coming up ahead!


### Freelance initializer method
{% highlight javascript %}
function initRect(w,h) {
	this.width = w;
	this.height = h;
	// personal instance method:
	this.area = function() {
		return this.height * this.width
	}
}
var rect5 = {};
initRect.call(rect5,1,5);
answer = rect5.area();
{% endhighlight %}

---

## Constructors

A constructor (aka Ctor) is just a freelance initializer method intended to be called in a special way:
{% highlight javascript %}
function Rect(w,h) {
	this.width = w;
	this.height = h;
	// personal instance method:
	this.area = function() {
		return this.height * this.width
	}
}
var rect6 = new Rect(3,2);
answer = rect6.area();
{% endhighlight %}
A Ctor represents a "class" in JS, a family of objects (instances) constructed in a similar way and sharing a formal "membership" or "pedigree".

### The _new_ operator

Always used with constructors to create objects:
{% highlight javascript %}
var obj = new Object(),
	arr = new Array(1,2,3),
	fun = new Function('x','return x*2'),
	num = new Number(7),
	str = new String('boo');
{% endhighlight %}

#### EXERCISE: pseudo-new

Try emulating new as a function:
{% highlight javascript %}
function new(Ctor) {
	//...
}
{% endhighlight %}

It should work like so:
{% highlight javascript %}
var rect7 = new(Rect,7,7);
answer = rect7.area(); // 49
{% endhighlight %}


But compare:
{% highlight javascript %}
rect6 instanceof Rect //true
rect7 instanceof Rect //false
// Also too:
rect6.constructor //Rect
rect7.constructor //Object
{% endhighlight %}
Pseudo-instance (made with pseudo-new) has wrong pedigree!
Operator `new` must be doing something more...

#### EXERCISE: Deque

Write a Ctor (constructor) which constructs a special kind of object called a 'deque' (short for 'Double-Ended-QUEue').  A deque is like an array, but it can only be accessed from its two ends, like a roll of mints.  Each deque instance should contain an array and should implement four methods:
{% highlight javascript %}
deque.push(item)
deque.pop()
deque.unshift(item)
deque.shift()
{% endhighlight %}
Each deque method will make a change to its own internal array using the array method of the same name.

Usage is like so:
{% highlight javascript %}
var deque = new Deque();
deque.push(2);
deque.unshift(1);
deque.push(3);
deque.shift(); //--> 1
deque.pop(); //--> 3
{% endhighlight %}

Use one of the patterns above in which instance methods are shared,
so that the following is true:
{% highlight javascript %}
var deque1 = new Deque(),
	deque2 = new Deque();
deque1.pop === deque2.pop; //-->true
{% endhighlight %}


#### EXERCISE: Rooms
Let's go back to game.js. Update the code in jsi-gamelib so that:

- There is a class called Room.
- When game.json is loaded, the list of descriptions is used to instantiate a list of Rooms.
- The Room class has methods for joining itself to its neighbors, so walls aren't drawn twice.

---

## Prototypes


Every Ctor has a prototype object, whose properties and methods supplement the Ctor's instances.


"Classes" in JS must be understood as the interaction of three relationships:

- Ctor <--> Instance
- Ctor <--> Prototype
- Instance <--> Prototype

Discuss...

Here is a fourth pattern for how instance methods can be shared:
attach them to the prototype instead of the instances.

{% highlight javascript %}
function Rect(w,h) {
	this.width = w;
	this.height = h;
}
Rect.prototype.area = function() {
	return this.width * this.height;
}
{% endhighlight %}


####EXERCISE: Monkey-patching Arrays
Add a method `interpolate(delimiter)` to Array.prototype which will be inherited by all Array instances. 


## Subclassing and Inheritance

Revisit our rectangle constructor:
{% highlight javascript %}
function Rect(w,h) {
	this.width = w;
	this.height = h;
}
Rect.prototype.area = function() {
	return this.width * this.height;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here's a subclass of Rect:
{% highlight javascript %}
// Start with independent ctor:
function Square(w) {
	this.width = this.height = w;
}
// Replace Square's default prototype with an instance of Rect:
Square.prototype = new Rect();
// BETTER:
// Square.prototype = Object.create(Rect.prototype)

// Link to the new prototype to its new Ctor:
Square.prototype.constructor = Square;

// Make and test an instance:
var sq = new Square(3);
sq.area() //9
sq instanceof Square // true
sq instanceof Rect // true
sq.constructor // Square
{% endhighlight %}


#### Subclassing Example: Stack

The Stack class is a subclass of a Deque which affords "last in, first out" behavior -- i.e. adding and removing from one end only.

{% highlight javascript %}
var Stack = (function () {
	function Stack (vals) {
		Deque.call(this,vals);
	}
	var proto = new Deque([]);
	// OR
	// var proto = Object.create(Deque.prototype);
	Stack.prototype = proto;
	proto.constructor = Stack;

	proto.unshift = undefined;
	proto.shift = undefined;
	proto.bottom = undefined;

	return Stack;
})();
{% endhighlight %}

####EXERCISE: Queue
Write a class Queue, an alternative to Stack which is another subclass of Deque.  Each Queue instance should afford "first in, first out" behavior, in which items are added to one end and removed from the other.
