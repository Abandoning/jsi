## Angular

[Angular.JS][angular] is a framework aimed particularly at building _single-page apps_. A single-page app, or SPA, is a website that serves a single HTML file that's modified by browser JS to build a dynamic web application. One of the earliest and most famous examples of an SPA is Gmail, which serves less than 100 lines of HTML before building its interface entirely in JavaScript.

## The Angular Tutorial

For today, work your way through [the official Angular tutorial][angular-tutorial]. There are tutorials on [Treehouse][treehouse-angular] and [Code School][codeschool-angular] as well, if you prefer video, but I found the official tutorial most useful.
