## Class Flow

- Class starts with slides. It'd be good to break out of the slides pretty
  often to give examples of things on the slides. Also, the students should
  follow along while going through the slides.

### Notes on learning

- Students should write down questions as they come up. Carrying a small
  notebook around with them could be a good idea.
- Everyone should try to come up with at least one question from the previous
  day's class to start off the following day.
- No programmer knows everything. A sign of strength and a great way to learn
  is to admit that you don't know what someone else is talking about.
- Solutions to many exercises will be available either directly on this site or
  by quickly searching on the internet. Students should use those as resources
  and tools for learning and not abuse them. Students should respect others'
  learning styles and not offer up solutions when they simply read it.
- Discuss impostor syndrome.
