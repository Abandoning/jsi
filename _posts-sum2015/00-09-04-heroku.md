Today we're going to publish something very basic to [Heroku][heroku]. We'll optionally set up a domain name via [Namecheap][namecheap] to work with the site.

### Exercise: Get started with Heroku

Follow the [Getting Started With Node.js guide][heroku-nodejs] in Heroku's documentation.

### Exercise: create a Heroku app for your portfolio site

Using what you've learned from the "getting started" guide, create and deploy a Heroku app for another Node or Express application you've built in class.

### Optional exercise: Custom Domain Name

Create an account with [Namecheap][namecheap] (or another registrar of your choice). Pick and buy a reasonably-priced domain name for your site. You can be stodgy like me and go for your-name.com, or get something a little more fun.

Once you've purchased a domain name, you need to make a CNAME record that points to your weird heroku url (e.g. warm-ice-73259.heroku.com).

Finally, tell Heroku about the domain. (Until you do, Heroku will respond with "no such app"). You can do it from the command line with `heroku domains:add DOMAIN`, or in the "Domains" section of the Heroku web interface.
