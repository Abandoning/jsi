## Books

I learn best by doing rather than reading, so please note that I have only
paged through most of these books. I'm sharing my thoughts from the little time
that I spent with each book in hopes that it helps expedite your search. I
would suggest reading reviews on Amazon and/or paging through the book yourself
at [Powell's][powells] to make sure the book matches your learning style and
expectations.

* _jQuery and JavaScript Phrasebook_, Brad Dayley  
  Beginner, $30  
  Good reference book, lots of examples. The examples don't go too deep, it's
  may be helpful to help point you in the right direction, but it's not a
  cookbook.

* _Jump Start JavaScript_, Ara Pehlivanian and Don Nguyen  
  Beginner, $30  
  This is a pretty good intro book. It covers the basics without too much
  extra.

* _Learning JavaScript_, Shelley Powers  
  Beginner, $35  
  Good intro to JavaScript in the browser, and covers most everything you
  would want to know at an introductory level.

* _JavaScript: The Good Parts_, Douglas Crockford  
  Intermediate, $30  
  This is one of the top selling JavaScript books, and it contains good
  tidbits, gotchas, and opinions. Overall, it's not going to teach you
  JavaScript, but it will explain why some JavaScript developers write code
  in a specific way.

* _Node.js in Action_, Mike Cantelon, Marc Harter, TJ Holowaychuk and Nathan Rajlich  
  Intermediate, $45  
  This is one of the most popular Node.js books, and is a pretty in depth look
  at various parts of Node.js and frameworks that are built with Node.

* _Learning Node_,  Shelley Powers  
  Intermediate, $35  
  This is a pretty in depth look at various parts of Node.js and frameworks
  that are built with Node. This books was written early in the lifetime of
  Node.js and may be slightly inaccurate because of that, but still covers
  details of up to date tools. _Node.js in Action_ may be a better choice, but
  this has material that complements the other as well.

* _Maintainable JavaScript_, Nicholas C. Zakas  
  Intermediate, $25  
  This book will probably teach you some good practices to keep you from forming
  bad habits.

* _Effective JavaScript_, David Herman  
  Intermediate, $20  
  This is a good book to teach you some finer points of JavaScript, how things
  work, which language features to use, and which to avoid.

* _Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja_, John Resig and Bear Bibeault  
  Advanced, $40  
  This is a good advanced book that will teach you about many real world
  concepts and practices for front-end JavaScript. John Resig is the creator
  of jQuery. His [blog](http://ejohn.org/category/blog/) also has a lot of
  valuable content.

* _Functional JavaScript_, Michael Fogus  
  Advanced, $30  
  This is an advanced book that gives good examples of advanced usage of
  functional programming concepts. It's a book that may cause your head
  to spin at times and sometimes has confusing explanations of concepts
  because it dives into each idea quickly. This book gives academic details
  on concepts like scope and closures.
