## JQuery

When you write JavaScript that runs in a browser, your code typically has to interact with the Document Object Model (_DOM_), as well as the various functions provided by the browser. These APIs are notoriously difficult to use. Here's some "infinite scroll" code that watches for the window to scroll to the bottom of a list of images, and attaches the response after it:

```JavaScript
window.addEventListener('scroll', function(event) {
  var windowHeight = window.innerHeight || document.documentElement.clientHeight;

  if (document.documentElement.scrollTop + windowHeight >= document.body.offsetHeight) {
    var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
    request.onload = function() {
      var entries;
      if (this.status === 200) {
        entries = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
        entries.forEach(function(entry) {
          var containingDiv = document.createElement('div'),
              image = document.createElement('img');
          image.setAttribute('src', entry['url']);
          containingDiv.appendChild(image);
          document.getElementById('images').appendChild(containingDiv);
        });
      } else {
        alert("Something went wrong. Please try again.");
      }
    }
    request.open("get", "page/2");
    request.send();
  }
});
```

jQuery is a library designed to save a lot of the work associated with the clunky interface of the browser. Consider this code, which uses jQuery to accomplish the same goal as the above:

```JavaScript
$(window).on('scroll', function(event) {
  if( $(window).scrollTop() + $(window).height() >= $(document).height()) {
    $.ajax('page/2', {
      dataType: 'json',
      success: function(entries) {
        entries.forEach(function(entry) {
          var containingDiv = $('<div>'),
              image = $('<img>');
          image.attr('src', entry['url']);
          containingDiv.append(image);
          $('#images').append(containingDiv);
        });
      },
      error: function() {
        alert("Something went wrong. Please try again.");
      }
    });
  }
});
```

The first thing you should notice here is the `$`. By convention, The jQuery library is stored in a variable called `$`, much as the lodash library uses `_`. The main thing to keep in mind is that `$` is just a variable name; it doesn't have any special meaning to javaScript and you can also refer to the jQuery library as `jQuery` if you prefer.

The second thing to notice is that the function names are shorter. Rather than `addEventListener`, `new XMLHTTPRequest`, and `appendChild`, we have `on`, `$.ajax`, and `append`. The effort of typing long function names isn't that great, but the effort saved by not having to _remember_ them can be significant, especially since the native DOM names are so inconsistent (`createElement` vs `appendChild` vs `childNodes`, for example).

### Exercise: using jQuery

Update your API-practice code from yesterday so it uses jQuery, rather than native DOM functions. Do you think it's easier to read this new version?

## Presentations jQuery functions

With a partner, prepare a presentation on one of these jQuery functions:

* [`.blur()` and `.focus()`](https://api.jquery.com/blur/)
* [`.show()`, `.hide()`, and `.toggle()`](https://api.jquery.com/show/)
* [`jQuery(html)`](https://api.jquery.com/jquery/#jQuery2)
* [`.css()`](https://api.jquery.com/css/)
* [`.before()` and `.after()`](https://api.jquery.com/before/)
* [`.data()`](https://api.jquery.com/data/)
* [`.detach() and `.remove()`](https://api.jquery.com/detach/)
* [`jQuery(selector)`](https://api.jquery.com/jquery/#jQuery1)
