Remember how objects let us group things together? We made a person that had
a `firstName` and `lastName`. Well this got us pretty far, but let's take
things a little further, try to build something a little bigger.

Let's pretend that we're building an application that models a tennis practice.
What's that involve? A bunch of objects!

- People
- Court
- Tennis Balls
- Tennis Raquets
- Ball basket
- Ball machine

That list could probably go on forever. We're going to explore the person and
the ball machine.

{% highlight javascript %}
var person = {
  name: 'Whitney',
  age: 11
};
var ballMachine = {
  capacity: 100,
  speed: {
    max: 80,
    min: 20
  },
  delay: {
    max: 60,
    min: 1
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

Please don't run that ball machine shooting balls at 80mph every second!

Now let's start a drill. We'll need to run the ball machine, and the person
will have to try to hit the ball back by running over to wherever it lands and
hitting it.

Ok, that shouldn't be so hard to model:

{% highlight javascript %}
/**
 * Run a ball machine.
 * @param {object} ballMachine - The ball machine to run.
 * @param {object} settings - Settings on which to run. You can include
 * `speed` and `delay` which must be within the thresholds of the
 * machine.
 * @param {function} cb - Called when each ball is fired.
 */
var run = function(ballMachine, settings, cb) {
  // implementation eventually does something like
  cb({ speed: 40, direction: '5deg' });
};
{% endhighlight %}

Now we just need to be able to make the person run to hit the ball:

{% highlight javascript %}
/**
 * Make a person run to a location.
 * @param {object} person - The person to make run.
 * @param {object} location - Where you want the person to run.
 * @param {function} cb - Called when the person arrives at the location.
 */
var run = function(person, location, cb) {
  // implementation eventually does something like
  cb({ location: location });
}
{% endhighlight %}

Well, we can't have two functions named `run`. So we have to make things more
verbose. Let's call them `runBallMachine` and `personRun`. Or we could just
rename them entirely. We could `start` the ball machine and still have the
person `run`. But then what if we eventually had a lesson that we wanted to
`start`? What if instead we could just associate the functions with the
objects that they represent? A person can `run` and a ball machine can `run`
too!



## _Is A_ vs _Has A_

## Functions vs Methods

## Object Oriented Design

You'll hear this term a lot. Programmers use it a lot. You need to know it.
You need to know it, but the truth is, you won't use it as much as one might
think. And actually, many programmers over-use object oriented concepts.
