## Class Flow

## Challenge

During the challenge, the students will be left to try to discover the idea
that they can set `this._genus` (and others) in `Apple` or `Banana` and that
will be used by the `Fruit.prototype.genus`. They'll also have the same thing
for `color`, but that will be a default value instead of a static value.

This will be a huge jump for some, but I think some people may just do the
right thing without guidance. We'll see. If people are totally lost, walk
through this together.
